                    <p>I created this website to share information with the world at large. To put something
                       out there and see what I got back. My thoughts, feelings, ideas, opinions and insights
                       all on display for worldwide web viewing. There are many things people don't get to hear
                       about before it's too late or would have been of more benefit if they knew about it sooner.
                       My hope is that this website can be a beacon for such things and that site visitors enjoy
                       their experience and find the site informative, educative, entertaining, insightful and
                       worthy of recommendation. Feel free to browse around, see what interests you. Let your
                       curiosity lead you...

                    <h2>Things You Hear Too Late In Life</h2>
                    <p>This is a short and non-exhaustive list on some things you hear too late in life.
                    </p></br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First impressions do matter because you MIGHT
                            only meet someone once or MIGHT only have one
                            chance and you MIGHT not know.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Exams should be embraced and your perspective on
                            them should change. View it as a chance to improve
                            your time-management skills.
                        </li>

                            circumstances may interrupt you at a future time" - John Trusier i.e.
                            Or as my Mom would say "Events have overtaken" (Do it now rather
                            than later)
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            If you really wanted to do something then you would have done it
                            already.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Work with time; the world operates on faith and trust.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Time is of the essence.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            We don't have time.

                            When it comes to doing something for yourself, 
                            investing in yourself; you reap what you sew 
                            i.e. you put in what you get out.

                            The odds are against you, things aren't in your 
                            favour, the system wasn't designed for you to get 
                            there in the first place, life is unfair, it's not 
                            straightforward and there is no obligation for 
                            anything to be given to you. It must be obtained or 
                            striven for.
                        </li>

                    <h2>My Favorite YouTube Channels</h2>
                    <p>Over the years, I have discovered some internet treasure through organic search,
                        recommendations from friends and some much welcome serendipity from the YouTube algorithm.
                        I am sharing some of my favourite YouTube channels which I tune into regularly during 
                        down time. Maybe you might discover a few good channels here or see some you might have
                        in common. If you do, please get in touch so we may frolic over our shared interest.
                    </p>

                        <p>This is a non-exhaustive list of all places where I have found ideas to sprout from.</p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Societal problems</li>
                            <li>World challenges</li>
                            <li>Inconveniences</li>
                            <li>Common problems experienced by groups of people</li>
                            <li>Simple crazy ideas e.g. putting a computer in every home, having worldwide internet via hot air ballon (Google Loon)</li>
                            <li>Innovatie minds</li>
                            <li>Daily hiccups e.g. the one mile problem in China, where people have to walk an extra mile on average from train stations to get to their destinations</li>
                            <li>Removing the middleman e.g. Creating a website where people can post houses for rent, essentially removing letting agents from the equation or with payments processing removing banks from the equation with quick processing</li>
                            <li>Changing society e.g. the first smartphone</li>
                            <li>Solving problems</li>
                            <li>Gaps in the market</li>
                            <li>I wish I could x</li>
                            <li>Changing something you don't like or doesn't work the way you want it to e.g. Mcbroken</li>
                            <li>Seeing something and improving it e.g. seeing a company website that you feel could be more polished and improving it for them</li>
                            <li>Removing steps in a process e.g. In banking, intermediate steps can be removed to make for an overall faster and more streamlined experience for the end-user</li>

                    <h2>Golden Time</h2>
                    <p> Postponing and Procrastination <br>
                        Hand in hand, sisters of sloth <br>
                        Much like "clothes" without "cloth" <br>
                        An unfinished word - <br> 
                        An unfinished word <br>
                        With intention of completion <br>
                        Few moments later - stifling stagnation <br>
                        A constant chronicle, going no where <br>
                        With no occurences to document. <br>
                        Or at least some without subsequent <br>
                        <br>
                        A deadly sin, just one of the seven <br>
                        It's paradoxical twin <br>
                        Patience. The virtue; associated with Heaven <br>
                        Stark and stellar opposites <br>
                        Similar on the surface, <br>
                        Often the two are confused <br>
                        <br>
                        However, they each have their respective identity <br>
                        Almost indistinguishable in character <br>
                        Nevertheless, there is a difference - <br>
                        Even though it be an inkling. <br>
                        <br>
                        In fact, the slothful are the most impatient <br>
                        For they have nothing to wait for <br>
                        They are too impatient to even begin. <br>
                        For a sloth, postpones the beginning <br>
                        In an attempt to reach the end. <br>
                        For the best of us; <br>
                        Tis only a matter of time. <br>
                        A time we must await. <br>
                        Anticipate. <br>
                        Brace. <br>
                        <br>
                        "Good things come to those who wait
                        but only the things left by those 
                        who hustle" <br>

                    <h2>Time Value of Money</h2>
                    <p> Time is money - Benjamin Franklin <br>
                        Long has it been known. <br>
                        Allow me to delve deeper into this rabbit hole. <br>
                        We spend money to save time. <br>
                        We spend time to save money. <br>
                        Time is bought; the way money is used to pay for i.e., service, <br>
                        We pay people for their time <br>
                        Time is invested in worthwhile endeavours, <br>
                        So too is money invested in these same endeavours. <br>
                        <br>
                        Time is infinite? <br>
                        Money is exponential; <br>
                        Literally the more the merrier, e. <br>
                        Money is man-made. <br>
                        Time, who made? <br>
                        Money is obtainable, <br>
                        However, it is quite unevenly distributed, <br>
                        A minority have more money than there are <br>
                        People on the Earth <br>
                        Whilst a majority have negative or none <br>
                        You know their titles <br>
                        You know their titles <br>
                        Time on the other hand, is quite evenly distributed. <br>
                        Everybody has time. <br>
                        Everybody has enough time. <br>
                        Nobody is deprived of time. <br>
                        As far as the eye can see (Not so far) (Not so far) <br>
                        Money may be the root of all evil, but time will kill us all. <br>
                        Time is precious. It cannot be refunded, repaired or replaced. <br>
                        Money is borrowed. Always. Only held onto for a finite period of time. <br>
                        There's a time for everything but money can't hold a candle to time. <br>
                        Money makes things convenient, but time makes things worthwhile. <br>

                        Rain - Falling sequentially <br>
                        Reams and reams of rain <br>
                        Plummeting, plummeting, hitting ground <br>
                        Again and again <br>
                        <br>
                        The walls were crying <br>
                        From the reflection of the droplets <br>
                        So composed and transluscent they took its shape. <br>
                        So idle they are individually but when they conglomerate <br>
                        They are overwhelming. <br>
                        <br>
                        A sort of ordered chaos <br>
                        Straight down they come authoritatively <br>
                        In neatly packed rows falling diagonally <br>
                        Repeatedly, running rampant:leeching all soil <br>
                        Carelessly eroding ravenously, causing turmoil <br>
                        <br>
                        And yet having said all this, it does <br>
                        Possess an awkward quality: rejuvenating, purifying <br>
                        It relinquishes all solitary. <br>
                        As ard as it is, it can be soft <br>
                        Becoming but a drizzle <br>
                        Continuously pouring, everlasting sometimes even a trickle. <br>
                        <br>
                        It's presence is like no other. The most timeless <br>
                        Of all the weathers. <br>
                        It comes in many different forms <br>
                        And its impact is tremendous <br>
                        <br>
                        In a blue moon it does rain down; <br>
                        Portending the illusion of Earth shifting dimension <br>
                        It's never changed, it's always been <br>
                        <br>
                        From dinosaurs to now. <br>
                        Yet everytime I am in the sea <br>
                        I cannot help but wow. <br>
                        It has fallen on our ancestors and predates <br>
                        Human life <br>
                        <br>
                        It truly is my favorite element <br>

                        An oxbridge "assessment" calling us forth <br>
                        <br>
                        Gort, Craughwell, Kiltartan Cross <br>
                        Flashed by us sequentially. <br>
                        Woodgroves and farmland freshened the mood <br>

                        <br>

                        Than Villiers'. Long flowing maxi <br>
                        Dresses; like gliding box jellyfish <br>
                        The girls sported their unique <br>
                        Combination of clothing. <br>
                        <br>
                        Depressed in appearance but <br>
                        Happy in conature as they knew <br>
                        It would all be worth it. <br>
                        The boys wore grey slacks. <br>
                        <br>
                        Familiar strangers they were: <br>
                        Smirking furtively as we <br>
                        Exchanged greetings <br>
                        We all knew why we were here. <br>
                        <br>
                        Tense emotions and involunatry gestures <br>
                        Wafted through the perfect chamber. <br>
                        The trial was brief. Comforted by <br>
                        Preliminary bouts, I manouvered steadily <br>
                        Through the talent trampling trial. <br>
                        Beaming hopefully in my direction <br>
                        Mother gave me a hiden smile <br>
                        Job well done "she" communicated <br>
                        As "she" maintained eye contact <br>
                        Throughout the handshake. <br>
                        Not a word was exchanged <br>
                        <br>
                        Returning certainly back to origin <br>
                        Time it seemed almost stood still <br>
                        The sun; feverishly blinking at me <br>
                        I exposed my arms to the heat. <br>
                        <br>
                        Going through the motions it <br>
                        Looked as though we were <br>
                        Time travelling trenmendously <br>
                        Through the sparse, more <br>
                        awe-evoking territories of the country. <br>
                        <br>
                        A couple feuding over Personal <br>
                        Affairs, sky morphing incessantly - <br>
                        As if to sum up the awkwardness <br>
                        Of the day. <br>
                        <br>
                        Finally, unfortuneately; all coming <br>
                        Back to accepted rest. <br>
                        And we were once again <br>
                        Subject to the monotonous repetition <br>
                        Of the present.<br>

                        A wonderful outing on a <br>

                    <p>  
                        What is secrecy but ellipsis of truth. <br>
                        A fine mechanism for those abundant in ruth <br>
                        Innocent in intent: eerie in execution <br>
                        For once a secret is shared, its existance <br>
                        Has ceased. <br>
                        Secrets are in solitude; they are best left <br>
                        To the remote. To the grave they "should" go <br>
                        Howver in company, enigmatic eavesdroppers lurk. <br>
                        Even the one with whom the secret is shared <br>
                        May have a quirk. <br>
                        Trust know-one they say for we only no ourselves <br>
                        Secrets are a padlocked pandora's box <br>
                        That should forever remain locked <br>
                        <br>
                        This leads us to lies in all their deceptions <br>
                        Follow liars in all their misdirections <br>
                        The lie is always out in front, for everyone to see. <br>
                        The truth is hidden, Hidden away from you and me. <br>
                        Now more than ever, we need it to come to light. <br>
                        The truth will be found, discovered, envisioned - <br>
                        Yes that's right. <br>
                        Like an artefact finally resurfaced by an archaeologist <br>
                        At work. <br>
                        All has been paid off, his dedication and research. <br>
                        The truth may be hidden but only for so long. <br>
                        Eventually is the word, don't forget  it's never <br>
                        Wrong. <br>
                        The truth will always seek the wrongdoer <br>
                        Around each and every turn. <br>
                        Imploring this one to run. <br>
                        It may not catch up instantly <br>
                        But eventually I concur. <br>
                        And when the truth does find you. <br>
                        It will always set you free. Always. <br>
                        A different kind of "free" <br>
                        <br>
                        Yonder when the truth is revealed <br>
                        And the lies washed off. <br>
                        For the unmistakeable glow of innocence <br>
                        To be revealed. <br>
                        Lone behold, they don't requite the feel. <br>
                        The people don't be-LIE-ve what they see. <br>
                        Why is the truth so hard to be-LIE-ve? <br>
                        Paradoxical no? <br>
                        Why can't people handle the truth? <br>
                        Yet when we are fed the lie we eat. <br>
                        <br>
                        Secrets, lies and truth. <br>
                        These are the things that govern our youth <br>
                        indistinguishable. Inseparable. Absolute. <br>
                        The wholly trinity <br>
                        <br>
                        If ever a God, the God could offer advice. <br>
                        T'would be; Do not look with thine eyes. <br>
                        Open your mind. The eyes are the simplest to deceive. <br>
                        Do not live life on mindless mute. <br>
                        Blind acceptance aids none. <br>
                        Challenge all, be resolute (astute) <br>

                        Do not fall for the optical illusion. <br>
                        The brighter the light, the darker the shadow <br>

                        Because people think that nobody knows. <br>
                        And so, the darkness proves paradoxical. <br>
                        It brings freedom; and it can act like an obstacle. <br>

                        I do not partake in their debauch√©e debates <br>
                        She likes to fill her mind with monily matters <br>
                        The two of them barking, jarring, bantering in their battles <br>
                        She doesn't like to admit when SHE is wrong. <br>
                        Somebody, there must be for HER to blame id her song <br>
                        And SHe singeth that song, oh so very frequently <br>
                        Much too often for a normal thinketh me. <br>
                        <br>
                        They fight and farce and flame into florid fantasy <br>
                        And I have to tame and guard them so helpeth me. <br>
                        For however much they think they know, - <br>
                        They are ever more clueless of my countenance <br>
                        <br>
                        For once I go, I do not know they they will continue <br>
                        With no-one to advise and chide and roll around <br>
                        With, I wonder how they'll be. <br>
                        Not so very merry <br>
                        Desolate and depressed <br>
                        Lower than the pits of hell <br>
                        Whilst I, higher than ever-est <br>
                        Shall be doing my best <br>
                        As I have always longed and prayed, since <br>
                        My days of youthfulness <br>
                        A madman I appear to be, in the eyes of <br>
                        These three (accounting for one who may not have <br>

                        Death. <br>

                    <h2>Road Ship</h2>
                    <p>
                        The bus hums indefinitely <br>
                        And I hear frequent chatter <br>
                        From conversations of different people. <br>
                        I tune in and I tune out - <br>
                        Sometimes I even look about - <br>
                        My Surroundings and those surrounding them <br>
                        The bus is stationary, almost dead. <br>
                        It's only lifeline, the hard lead - <br>
                        Battery of the Seacrest bus, <br>
                        To Eyre Square it carried us. <br>
                        Still immobile. Still waiting, <br>
                        I see some leaves that are fighting - <br>
                        With the wind, it's a struggle, <br>
                        Now they've came thought its all been settled. <br>
                        Time continues to pass without permission. <br>
                        I see an ad it's for television. <br>
                        "5 hours sleep is plenty" it envisions. <br>
                        <br>
                        The bus is then resusitated. <br>
                        Taken aback I almost feinted - <br>
                        At thought of life and death we're well acquainted. <br>
                        We slowly approach the Galway Cathedral <br>
                        The atmosphere is unequaled. <br>
                        To be in there, there's no equal. <br>
                        <br>
                        The stop dings once, twice. <br>
                        Once again we're alright. <br>
                        I pass a puddle and I see a dog <br>
                        Its coat was hashbrown with a tramp's walk <br>
                        I see some people on the sidewalk. <br>
                        That idle boy makes the bus again <br>
                        Everyday without fail. <br>
                        His north face jacket shields sun <br>
                        I hear the music drop once again <br>
                        The beat drops like raindrops. <br>
                        I hear cars skid on gravel <br>
                        Tire marks, from past travel <br>
                        <br>
                        The bus huffs and the bus puffs <br>
                        Not too far now, that is for us. <br>
                        Last stop is in view. The button <br>
                        dings <br>

                    <h2>Safari</h2>
                    <p>
                        We arrived in Calle, Mirafondo, Playa Honda, Lanzarote <br>
                        Yesterday. But I am writing this today. <br>
                        During the plane's descent I had never <br>
                        Seen a water so blue and solid looking. <br>
                        Like a large - aqua, navy series of moving <br>
                        Clouds with glints of bright white where <br>
                        The sun shined and refracted light. <br>
                        <br>
                        I stepped of the plane. <br>
                        A slightly stuffy heat greeted me. <br>
                        Familiar I thought as the air cramped <br>
                        And compressed me. <br>
                        <br>
                        We reached our apartment. <br>
                        "Gracias" I offered enthusiastically <br>
                        As the aged taxi driver humbly <br>
                        Opened my door for me. <br>
                        Out of nowhere it seemed, our hostess appeared. <br>
                        Vanessa - sunkissed skin and onyx eyed <br>
                        She guided us up the orange <br>
                        Sunburnt, stoney steps <br>
                        <br>
                        A warm welcome we received from her. <br>
                        The apartment exceeded expectations. <br>
                        As described and not implied. <br>
                        Complete with balcony and art work. <br>
                        Don't forget the view! <br>
                        <br>
                        We sort out final queries and mother beams - <br>
                        Satisfied - in Vanessa's direction. <br>
                        She gives us her final goodbyes in that <br>
                        Spontaneous! Spanish? accent. (Trace of Mexican?) <br>
                        And we look one another up and down <br>
                        As we express our excitement <br>
                        Happy family <br>
                        <br>
                        Now I am sitting at the balcony - <br>
                        Writing this poem as we experience. <br>
                        It is surprisingly windy this morning, <br>
                        The balcony door ricketed and <br>
                        Racketed all night - <br>
                        As if... <br>
                        The wind is fierce and strong <br>
                        Though I would be more inclined to call it - <br>
                        A gusty breeze. <br>
                        The shuttered roof o'erhead clicks and <br>
                        Clacks into place as it repeatedly <br>
                        Comes alive and dies. <br>
                        Briefly levitating then abruptly playing dead. <br>
                        An autonomous process perhaps. <br>
                        The view is puzzling, neo - proudly pacific <br>
                        I lift my head to write these descriptions <br>
                        And I spy with my naked eye - <br>
                        <br>
                        A blanket of white-snow houses with <br>
                        Little cloth drapes that gently flap in the breeze. <br>
                        It's a breeze. <br>
                        The breeze is satisfying as it deters the heat <br>
                        Of the yoadling yellow sun. <br>
                        In the distance I see the mightiest of mountains <br>
                        Towering triumphantly over the tropical terrain. <br>

                    <p>
                        I looked up and I saw; <br>
                        Dense puffs of white smoke <br>
                        In the ubiquitous sky. <br>
                        <br>
                        An everlasting blink later and - <br>
                        Slight trails of cotton wool swelled <br>
                        Happily like a viscal vortex. <br>
                        I saw them standing in the shadows - <br>
                        Behind one another. <br>
                        A green army, as the bus <br>
                        Entered their woodland territory <br>
                        Trrrr Trrrr - a sudden flummox of rain <br>
                        The pitter patter rattled the roof of the bus <br>
                        We picked up speed. VROOOOOOM <br>
                        VROOOOOOOOM VROOOOOOOOM <br>
                        Then settled into a constant whir of the engine. <br>
                        Rain providing a natural white noise <br>
                        Backdrop to the myriad of sensuous sounds. <br>
                        I am writing poetry on a bus. <br>
                        I must be crazy I thought <br>
                        AS the bus sailed on the sea of the road <br>
                        Through the onslaught of rain crashing <br>
                        Down from the upside down ocean. <br>
                        And suddenly light came from a corner. <br>
                        I thought I saw the heavens <br>
                        The road glowing yellow as light <br>
                        Probed through the windows and <br>
                        Ceiling window. <br>
                        I could see mother nature; breathing, <br>
                        From the movement of the trees <br>
                        What a moment!!! <br>
                        A grand orchestra; composed of everything natural <br>
                        A harmonised motion as all organisms <br>
                        Sway in sync, ever moving. <br>
                        Ever breathing. Always synchronising <br>
                        Never out of phase <br>
                        Resonance <br>
                        Mother nature is always at her fundamental <br>
                        Frequency. I can feel it when I observe <br>
                        The indifference is stifling, colossal. <br>
                        I see the bus shed tears as the <br>
                        Wind blows raindrops across the window; <br>
                        Leaving trails of tears in its face. <br>
                        The bus is crying. <br>
                        Perhaps because it cannot be part <br>
                        Of the orchestra. <br>
                        The sun comes out of hiding <br>
                        As the captivating, coloured white <br>
                        Clouds lower their guard temporarily. <br>
                        They tell a tale of an epic war <br>
                        Fought by the Gods in the sky; <br>
                        The deep cuts, crevices, tears and <br>
                        Streaks present are representative of this. <br>
                        The sun illuminates everything with its <br>
                        Familiar, warm, resplendent, compelling, <br>
                        Marvel instigating presence. <br>
                        Unmistakeable. <br>
                        I always knew when the sun is out <br>
                        But I have to look for the moon sometimes. <br>
                        The sun is always full <br>
                        But the moon is partial <br>
                        Now the cloyds group round the mighty sun. <br>
                        It rests majestically atop the <br>
                        Foundation of the faithful clouds <br>
                        It appears to be a shining <br>
                        Bright yellow outer red <br>
                        Glass orb that appears <br>
                        To be the cynosure <br>
                        In the midst of the sky that <br>
                        Maneuvers round it. <br>
                        Back to the man's world I have to go, <br>
                        Though, I always long to come back. <br>
                        The journey I have set on now <br>
                        Will be four years long on the way <br>
                        Back <br>

                            <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                                <li>Be aware of your seating choice.</li>

                                <li>Have an awareness of those listening to you and watching when you 
                                    are asking questions in class.
                                </li>

                                <li>Keep comments/opinions about lecture attendance, exams, assignments, 
                                    emails and etc. to yourself and don't offer the freely unless explicitly asked.
                                </li>

                                <li>In group work assignments, ensure your part is done.</li>

                                <li>For big projects that may take up too much time and are not so straight-forward,
                                    always try to have something to show for your efforts as much as possible by bagging
                                    the 'low hanging fruit' and compiling results for those then tackle the more challenging
                                    portions of the project afterwards. Do this in case something unexpected happens so you 
                                    still have marks for your project, especially the Final Year Project (FYP).
                                </li>

                                <li>Make your learning your own from start to finish. Do not allow a third party to dictate 
                                    your learning preferences. Your degree is what you make of it!
                                </li>

                                <li>Look into the type of degree that will be awarded and meaning of the grade levels.</li>

                                <li>The Junior year is a bit more intense as modules increase in workload and complexity,
                                    adequately prepare for this by putting appropriate measures in place and ensuring you 
                                    take care of your mental health to keep yourself in tact.
                                </li>

                                <li>The Final Year is what makes a the degree an honours degree, it is the most intense year
                                    where significant effort will have to be expended and new challenges and changes will be 
                                    introduced. Pace yourself, as you will be spread thin whilst attending to coursework and
                                    simultaneously job hunting. Watch your health, prioritise your well-being, stay organized,
                                    meet the tight deadlines and hand in work on time and done well with the 'little things'
                                    that add bells and whistles to your assignment that make it standout and will earn you those

                                    beyond (will probably write about this soon). This is the time to cement your years of study
                                    by plowing, driving steadily and assuredly to the end not time to fluff and take your foot 
                                    off the pedal and drop the ball. Make sure those closest to you are well aware of the demands
                                    and commitments being made by you in this final year. Ad astra.

                                        on purpose. Unnecessary self-inflicted grade loss. Collect the marks wherever you can and
                                        get the grade you deserve. You are more than capable. It only goes to your advantage. So get
                                        the grades that are reflective of your ablities, if not for you then at least for your parents, 
                                        employers, graduate school etc.

                                        You don't have to like a module to get the grades, find another purpose behind 
                                        why you are taking the module i.e. to make sure you have good grades for graduate school.
                                        Gain perspective.

                                    <li>Not getting the grades I could because I didn't follow the lecturer's assiged method. Just
                                        follow the lecturer's method and do your own method too. Originality is always a plus.
