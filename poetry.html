					<h3>Golden Time</h3>
					<p> Postponing and Procrastination <br>
						Hand in hand, sisters of sloth <br>
						Much like "clothes" without "cloth" <br>
						An unfinished word - <br> 
						An unfinished word <br>
						With intention of completion <br>
						Few moments later - stifling stagnation <br>
						A constant chronicle, going no where <br>
						With no occurences to document. <br>
						Or at least some without subsequent <br>
						<br>
						A deadly sin, just one of the seven <br>
						It's paradoxical twin <br>
						Patience. The virtue; associated with Heaven <br>
						Stark and stellar opposites <br>
						Similar on the surface, <br>
						Often the two are confused <br>
						<br>
						However, they each have their respective identity <br>
						Almost indistinguishable in character <br>
						Nevertheless, there is a difference - <br>
						Even though it be an inkling. <br>
						<br>
						In fact, the slothful are the most impatient <br>
						For they have nothing to wait for <br>
						They are too impatient to even begin. <br>
						For a sloth, postpones the beginning <br>
						In an attempt to reach the end. <br>
						For the best of us; <br>
						Tis only a matter of time. <br>
						A time we must await. <br>
						Anticipate. <br>
						Brace. <br>
						<br>
						"Good things come to those who wait
						but only the things left by those 
						who hustle" <br>
						- Abe Lincoln <br>

					<h3>Time Value of Money</h3>
					<p> Time is money - Benjamin Franklin <br>
						Long has it been known. <br>
						Allow me to delve deeper into this rabbit hole. <br>
						We spend money to save time. <br>
						We spend time to save money. <br>
						Time is bought; the way money is used to pay for i.e., service, <br>
						We pay people for their time <br>
						Time is invested in worthwhile endeavours, <br>
						So too is money invested in these same endeavours. <br>
						<br>
						Time is infinite? <br>
						Money is exponential; <br>
						Literally the more the merrier, e. <br>
						Money is man-made. <br>
						Time, who made? <br>
						Money is obtainable, <br>
						However, it is quite unevenly distributed, <br>
						A minority have more money than there are <br>
						People on the Earth <br>
						Whilst a majority have negative or none <br>
						You know their titles <br>
						You know their titles <br>
						Time on the other hand, is quite evenly distributed. <br>
						Everybody has time. <br>
						Everybody has enough time. <br>
						Nobody is deprived of time. <br>
						As far as the eye can see (Not so far) (Not so far) <br>
						Money may be the root of all evil, but time will kill us all. <br>
						Time is precious. It cannot be refunded, repaired or replaced. <br>
						Money is borrowed. Always. Only held onto for a finite period of time. <br>
						There's a time for everything but money can't hold a candle to time. <br>
						Money makes things convenient, but time makes things worthwhile. <br>

					<h3>The Onslaught</h3>
					<p>  
						Rain - Falling sequentially <br>
						Reams and reams of rain <br>
						Plummeting, plummeting, hitting ground <br>
						Again and again <br>
						<br>
						The walls were crying <br>
						From the reflection of the droplets <br>
						So composed and transluscent they took its shape. <br>
						So idle they are individually but when they conglomerate <br>
						They are overwhelming. <br>
						<br>
						A sort of ordered chaos <br>
						Straight down they come authoritatively <br>
						In neatly packed rows falling diagonally <br>
						Repeatedly, running rampant:leeching all soil <br>
						Carelessly eroding ravenously, causing turmoil <br>
						<br>
						And yet having said all this, it does <br>
						Possess an awkward quality: rejuvenating, purifying <br>
						It relinquishes all solitary. <br>
						As ard as it is, it can be soft <br>
						Becoming but a drizzle <br>
						Continuously pouring, everlasting sometimes even a trickle. <br>
						<br>
						It's presence is like no other. The most timeless <br>
						Of all the weathers. <br>
						It comes in many different forms <br>
						And its impact is tremendous <br>
						<br>
						In a blue moon it does rain down; <br>
						Portending the illusion of Earth shifting dimension <br>
						It's never changed, it's always been <br>
						<br>
						From dinosaurs to now. <br>
						Yet everytime I am in the sea <br>
						I cannot help but wow. <br>
						It has fallen on our ancestors and predates <br>
						Human life <br>
						<br>
						It truly is my favorite element <br>
						But for other reasons tight <br>

					<h3>The Oxbridge Summons</h3>
					<p>  
						Seven-thirty in the morning <br>
						The sky met the asphalt road <br>
						Driving to heaven - <br>
						An oxbridge "assessment" calling us forth <br>
						<br>
						Gort, Craughwell, Kiltartan Cross <br>
						Flashed by us sequentially. <br>
						Woodgroves and farmland freshened the mood <br>
						Upper class vehicles shunned our path.151. <br>
						<br>
						On arrival greeted by none other <br>
						Than Villiers'. Long flowing maxi <br>
						Dresses; like gliding box jellyfish <br>
						The girls sported their unique <br>
						Combination of clothing. <br>
						<br>
						Depressed in appearance but <br>
						Happy in conature as they knew <br>
						It would all be worth it. <br>
						The boys wore grey slacks. <br>
						<br>
						Familiar strangers they were: <br>
						Smirking furtively as we <br>
						Exchanged greetings <br>
						We all knew why we were here. <br>
						<br>
						Tense emotions and involunatry gestures <br>
						Wafted through the perfect chamber. <br>
						The trial was brief. Comforted by <br>
						Preliminary bouts, I manouvered steadily <br>
						Through the talent trampling trial. <br>
						Beaming hopefully in my direction <br>
						Mother gave me a hiden smile <br>
						Job well done "she" communicated <br>
						As "she" maintained eye contact <br>
						Throughout the handshake. <br>
						Not a word was exchanged <br>
						<br>
						Returning certainly back to origin <br>
						Time it seemed almost stood still <br>
						The sun; feverishly blinking at me <br>
						I exposed my arms to the heat. <br>
						<br>
						Going through the motions it <br>
						Looked as though we were <br>
						Time travelling trenmendously <br>
						Through the sparse, more <br>
						awe-evoking territories of the country. <br>
						<br>
						A couple feuding over Personal <br>
						Affairs, sky morphing incessantly - <br>
						As if to sum up the awkwardness <br>
						Of the day. <br>
						<br>
						Finally, unfortuneately; all coming <br>
						Back to accepted rest. <br>
						And we were once again <br>
						Subject to the monotonous repetition <br>
						Of the present.<br>
						<br>
						A wonderful outing on a <br>
						Dreary dawn. <br>
					</p>

				<div class="poem" id="poem5">
					<h3>Secrets, Lies, Truth</h3>
					<p>  
						What is secrecy but ellipsis of truth. <br>
						A fine mechanism for those abundant in ruth <br>
						Innocent in intent: eerie in execution <br>
						For once a secret is shared, its existance <br>
						Has ceased. <br>
						Secrets are in solitude; they are best left <br>
						To the remote. To the grave they "should" go <br>
						Howver in company, enigmatic eavesdroppers lurk. <br>
						Even the one with whom the secret is shared <br>
						May have a quirk. <br>
						Trust know-one they say for we only no ourselves <br>
						Secrets are a padlocked pandora's box <br>
						That should forever remain locked <br>
						<br>
						This leads us to lies in all their deceptions <br>
						Follow liars in all their misdirections <br>
						The lie is always out in front, for everyone to see. <br>
						The truth is hidden, Hidden away from you and me. <br>
						Now more than ever, we need it to come to light. <br>
						The truth will be found, discovered, envisioned - <br>
						Yes that's right. <br>
						Like an artefact finally resurfaced by an archaeologist <br>
						At work. <br>
						All has been paid off, his dedication and research. <br>
						The truth may be hidden but only for so long. <br>
						Eventually is the word, don't forget  it's never <br>
						Wrong. <br>
						The truth will always seek the wrongdoer <br>
						Around each and every turn. <br>
						Imploring this one to run. <br>
						It may not catch up instantly <br>
						But eventually I concur. <br>
						And when the truth does find you. <br>
						It will always set you free. Always. <br>
						A different kind of "free" <br>
						<br>
						Yonder when the truth is revealed <br>
						And the lies washed off. <br>
						For the unmistakeable glow of innocence <br>
						To be revealed. <br>
						Lone behold, they don't requite the feel. <br>
						The people don't be-LIE-ve what they see. <br>
						Why is the truth so hard to be-LIE-ve? <br>
						Paradoxical no? <br>
						Why can't people handle the truth? <br>
						Yet when we are fed the lie we eat. <br>
						<br>
						Secrets, lies and truth. <br>
						These are the things that govern our youth <br>
						indistinguishable. Inseparable. Absolute. <br>
						The wholly trinity <br>
						<br>
						If ever a God, the God could offer advice. <br>
						T'would be; Do not look with thine eyes. <br>
						Open your mind. The eyes are the simplest to deceive. <br>
						Do not live life on mindless mute. <br>
						Blind acceptance aids none. <br>
						Challenge all, be resolute (astute) <br>

					<h3>Nominal Ordeal</h3>
					<p>  
						Morning dew lies deep within - <br>
						The grass that's cuddled here. <br>
						For wonder awaits a better place <br>
						To reminisce with peers <br>
						<br>
						Omification and jubilation are but <br>
						Mere jewels - which should be <br>
						Kept in times of displacement or <br>
						Labryinthal fears. <br>
						<br>
						Lest one wishes to become abashed <br>
						By bad burdens and fraudulent <br>
						Fallacies, it should be notioned not, <br>
						That choice of this matter is <br>
						Misinterpreted. <br>
						<br>
						So please be weary of false faces <br>
						And enigmatic entites that lurk. <br>
						For what awaits does not abate <br>
						To one's own doings or work. <br>

						Those colours which emit <br>

						Than any sun, more definitive <br>
						Than any star. Each distinctive <br>
						In their respective styles. <br>
						<br>
						Manifesting in themselves each <br>
						Other's qualities - As happy as <br>
						Rain. Stiriking and Bold, entwining <br>

					<h3>Parentheses</h3>
					<p>  
						When you witness an eagle <br>
						In flight, you experience <br>
						Epiphany of wonder. Being <br>
						One with all and nothing <br>
						At all - is something very <br>
						Wholesome. <br>
						<br>
						Woven in and out of time, <br>
						Alternate reality is just - <br>
						Out of sight. The bird <br>
						Is somehow perpetually <br>
						Betwixting, verging on the <br>
						Unreal whilst maintaining <br>
						some - atom - of thought. <br>
						<br>
						Leave open the doors of <br>
						Perception when encountering <br>
						Phenomena. Else would <br>

					<h3>The Medium</h3>
					<p>  
						Silence is patience, in its most purest of forms. <br>
						Mistaken for arrogance when scorned. <br>
						Unhasteful, Unwasteful. <br>
						Through no noise can all noise be heard. <br>
						<br>
						Comtemplating, calculating, intricately assessing - <br>
						Not! interrupting floq, no. <br>
						Louder than any library <br>
						Oh so close to death. <br>
						I can almost hear it (Quickly) - <br>

						Forget. <br>

					<h3>AFTERMATH</h3>
					<p>  
						Cold and dreary, morbid and dark <br>
						That's the way the picture's - <br>
						Been painted. A frightful passage <br>
						Somewhat stark though some - <br>
						Are still ready to face it. <br>
						<br>
						Although really let's think about it <br>
						Can one ever be ready - <br>
						For such an unexpected and <br>
						Uninvited guest who supposedly comes <br>
						And steals away the "packages" <br>
						Leaving behind the rest. <br>
						<br>
						Sadly we can only imagine - <br>
						The sort of circumstances surrounding - <br>
						This phenomena, <br>
						Eddying round cluelessly this nebulous orbit <br>
						Until finally encountering this last one <br>
						Constant <br>
						<br>
						For nobody and no one has <br>
						Come back to explain, this <br>
						Perpetual query of a finite existance <br>
						How baffling is that - <br>
						Which some people spend their <br>
						Whole journey trying to make sense - <br>
						Of that <br>
						Awaiting the inevitable <br>
						No Thanks. <br>

					<h3>The Ball That Cannot be Caught</h3>
					<p>
						I wish I could throw you this ball <br>
						This energetic and furious ball <br>
						This intense focus of light. <br>
						Heck so bright even visible at night. <br>
						<br>
						It's been pumped by something different. <br>
						No, not air, not like that all. More like a - <br>
						<br>
						It's a ball with something in it <br>
						But a thing I cannot explain. <br>
						Something unique and different about it. <br>
						Charismatic yet I cannot transfer the flame <br>
						<br>
						To somebody through word <br>
						For it must be experienced. <br>
						No not crystal/material, that's rigid. <br>
						Loosely accept that term ball. <br>
						<br>
						For once you've found it's child's play. <br>
						As it shines the brightest of all. <br>

					<h3>Familia</h3>

						Father is stern and unyielding, <br>
						Joyful and carefree solemn. <br>
						Rigid in view and outlook <br>
						But for reason drilled in through childhood. <br>
						As moveable as a rock <br>
						And fluid as a custard. <br>
						Troubled not by shame <br>
						But pride maketh almost rot <br>
						<br>
						By cordial contrast comes Mother <br>
						A truly divine being. <br>
						One of fine wisdom, and <br>
						Experienced understanding. <br>
						Deliriously brilliant and cherished is my thought <br>
						Of laying down on luxurious <br>
						Lillipads and laughing lovingly <br>
						With my Mom <br>
						<br>
						Do not let these descriptions <br>
						Fool you. For they are only <br>
						Lovely dresses, if you were <br>
						Taken aback then this one <br>
						is for you! <br>
						<br>
						Both Yin and Yang are needed. <br>
						Both complement and contrast <br>
						In a similar way yes, antithesis! <br>
						Alas. Understand the meaning <br>
						<br>
						Don't dwindle on the facts - <br>
						Just flipping love your (Father <br>

					<h3>Man is Broadend by its own Accord</h3>
					<p>
						A truth be told to rupture <br>
						The Lands, preventing, procrastinating <br>
						Pretention, Like a rubber band <br>
						It is like - tending towards its own <br>
						Limits. <br>
						<br>
						Blindly viewing the outset as <br>
						One large levitating latency. <br>
						Meagrely awaiting an uncalming <br>
						Force. <br>
						<br>
						Abstract is the idea that <br>
						Expectation be met minus <br>

					<h3>Epiphany</h3>
					<p>
						It's difficult to assess the <br>
						True power of this, thing. <br>
						Inspiration or energy and <br>
						The power that it brings <br>
						<br>
						Akin to a lucid dream - <br>
						From which one desires not to arise, <br>
						It reveals the conspicuous nature <br>
						Of tasks complex through our eyes. <br>
						It unravels, gently, what appears to be masked. <br>
						However, of anything from "us" - <br>
						It has never asked. <br>
						<br>
						It leaves the vessel it inhabits <br>
						In an almost trance like state. <br>
						Manifesting itself - <br>
						Yet always yearning to migrate. <br>
						Lucid in the sense: <br>
						We are aware of its presence. <br>
						Dream: to describe its heavenly transcendence. <br>
						<br>
						An embellisshment of purity, <br>
						An undeserved right - <br>
						The ability to resonate with nature, <br>
						"The Liquor Never Brewed" - <br>
						That's how Dickinson deemed it, right. <br>
						An elusive desire, hiding - <br>
						In plain sight. <br>
						A sudden divine vocation, imploring <br>
						The use of one's might. <br>
						<br>
						It's difficult to comprehend this - <br>
						Unnatural phenomenon. <br>
						Like a nomad in the desert, <br>
						It travels on and on. <br>
						I could continue to ramble <br>
						And I still wouldn't cover it all. <br>
						Oh dear inspiration, together we work best. <br>

						I can only pray it stays <br>
						And forever manifests <br>

					<h3>Friday Feeling in Transit</h3>
					<p>
						I sit here wiith pen to paper <br>
						At the back of the bus like a skyscraper. <br>
						I can see all as I look out the window <br>
						I pass the GAA pitch and the beach - <br>
						The army barracks and the HQ <br>
						<br>
						The bus comes to a full stop. <br>
						People waiting at the bus stop. <br>
						They walk forward, leaning on one side, <br>
						I try to hide, a wry smile - <br>
						As the bus then restarts its journey, <br>
						Rowing like a row boat - <br>
						Going over bumps and pot-holes. <br>
						<br>
						Suddenly, I am floating <br>
						I look out and girls are boarding - <br>
						the bus, one of them scouring. <br>
						We are stoppped now at a red light. <br>
						The Friday Feeling is alight. <br>
						I hear music from another source. <br>
						It rattles low and it changes course. <br>
						<br>
						We race through the narrow road. <br>
						Zooming past shops new and old. <br>
						The bus rackets, the music pops, <br>
						The road is free and time stops <br>
						So suddenly, people drop, off the bus <br>
						And hurry out. <br>
						A flock of sheep, a pack of wolves, <br>
						They hoarded spaces as they only could. <br>
						Coming down the aisle, it happened as it would. <br>

					<h3>Crass Contrast (Yin-Yang Paradox)</h3>
					<p>
						It's shining darkly and it's so bright. <br>
						One is darkness and one is light. <br>
						Just as light brightens (reveals), so it blinds. - <br>
						And these have stood the test of time, <br>
						Strange thoughts that will bend the mind. <br>
						Do not fall for the optical illusion. <br>
						The brighter the light, the darker the shadow <br>
						Light reveals desire - on truth - casts shadow. <br>
						<br>
						Darkness, anonymity; you can now see people - <br>
						For their true identity. <br>
						Mask on, mask off. <br>
						It makes no difference when the lights off. <br>
						The darkness provides false security. <br>
						It cloaks all and reveals more than the <br>
						Eye can see. <br>
						In the dark, anything goes - <br>
						Because people think that nobody knows. <br>
						And so, the darkness proves paradoxical. <br>
						It brings freedom; and it can act like an obstacle. <br>
						<br>
						The dark night or the bright of day <br>
						The blinding light or the karst darkness <br>
						(stripped bare of all - carcass) <br>
						Two sides of the same coin. <br>
						They diverge and then they join. <br>

						Why do we enter this world cluelessly <br>

					<h3>Safari</h3>
					<p>
						We arrived in Calle, Mirafondo, Playa Honda, Lanzarote <br>
						Yesterday. But I am writing this today. <br>
						During the plane's descent I had never <br>
						Seen a water so blue and solid looking. <br>
						Like a large - aqua, navy series of moving <br>
						Clouds with glints of bright white where <br>
						The sun shined and refracted light. <br>
						<br>
						I stepped of the plane. <br>
						A slightly stuffy heat greeted me. <br>
						Familiar I thought as the air cramped <br>
						And compressed me. <br>
						<br>
						We reached our apartment. <br>
						"Gracias" I offered enthusiastically <br>
						As the aged taxi driver humbly <br>
						Opened my door for me. <br>
						Out of nowhere it seemed, our hostess appeared. <br>
						Vanessa - sunkissed skin and onyx eyed <br>
						She guided us up the orange <br>
						Sunburnt, stoney steps <br>
						<br>
						A warm welcome we received from her. <br>
						The apartment exceeded expectations. <br>
						As described and not implied. <br>
						Complete with balcony and art work. <br>
						Don't forget the view! <br>
						<br>
						We sort out final queries and mother beams - <br>
						Satisfied - in Vanessa's direction. <br>
						She gives us her final goodbyes in that <br>
						Spontaneous! Spanish? accent. (Trace of Mexican?) <br>
						And we look one another up and down <br>
						As we express our excitement <br>
						Happy family <br>
						<br>
						Now I am sitting at the balcony - <br>
						Writing this poem as we experience. <br>
						It is surprisingly windy this morning, <br>
						The balcony door ricketed and <br>
						Racketed all night - <br>
						As if... <br>
						The wind is fierce and strong <br>
						Though I would be more inclined to call it - <br>
						A gusty breeze. <br>
						The shuttered roof o'erhead clicks and <br>
						Clacks into place as it repeatedly <br>
						Comes alive and dies. <br>
						Briefly levitating then abruptly playing dead. <br>
						An autonomous process perhaps. <br>
						The view is puzzling, neo - proudly pacific <br>
						I lift my head to write these descriptions <br>
						And I spy with my naked eye - <br>
						<br>
						A blanket of white-snow houses with <br>
						Little cloth drapes that gently flap in the breeze. <br>
						It's a breeze. <br>
						The breeze is satisfying as it deters the heat <br>
						Of the yoadling yellow sun. <br>
						In the distance I see the mightiest of mountains <br>
						Towering triumphantly over the tropical terrain. <br>

					<h3>A Transitioning Transit</h3>
					<p>
						I looked up and I saw; <br>
						Dense puffs of white smoke <br>
						In the ubiquitous sky. <br>
						<br>
						An everlasting blink later and - <br>
						Slight trails of cotton wool swelled <br>
						Happily like a viscal vortex. <br>
						I saw them standing in the shadows - <br>
						Behind one another. <br>
						A green army, as the bus <br>
						Entered their woodland territory <br>
						Trrrr Trrrr - a sudden flummox of rain <br>
						The pitter patter rattled the roof of the bus <br>
						We picked up speed. VROOOOOOM <br>
						VROOOOOOOOM VROOOOOOOOM <br>
						Then settled into a constant whir of the engine. <br>
						Rain providing a natural white noise <br>
						Backdrop to the myriad of sensuous sounds. <br>
						I am writing poetry on a bus. <br>
						I must be crazy I thought <br>
						AS the bus sailed on the sea of the road <br>
						Through the onslaught of rain crashing <br>
						Down from the upside down ocean. <br>
						And suddenly light came from a corner. <br>
						I thought I saw the heavens <br>
						The road glowing yellow as light <br>
						Probed through the windows and <br>
						Ceiling window. <br>
						I could see mother nature; breathing, <br>
						From the movement of the trees <br>
						What a moment!!! <br>
						A grand orchestra; composed of everything natural <br>
						A harmonised motion as all organisms <br>
						Sway in sync, ever moving. <br>
						Ever breathing. Always synchronising <br>
						Never out of phase <br>
						Resonance <br>
						Mother nature is always at her fundamental <br>
						Frequency. I can feel it when I observe <br>
						The indifference is stifling, colossal. <br>
						I see the bus shed tears as the <br>
						Wind blows raindrops across the window; <br>
						Leaving trails of tears in its face. <br>
						The bus is crying. <br>
						Perhaps because it cannot be part <br>
						Of the orchestra. <br>
						The sun comes out of hiding <br>
						As the captivating, coloured white <br>
						Clouds lower their guard temporarily. <br>
						They tell a tale of an epic war <br>
						Fought by the Gods in the sky; <br>
						The deep cuts, crevices, tears and <br>
						Streaks present are representative of this. <br>
						The sun illuminates everything with its <br>
						Familiar, warm, resplendent, compelling, <br>
						Marvel instigating presence. <br>
						Unmistakeable. <br>
						I always knew when the sun is out <br>
						But I have to look for the moon sometimes. <br>
						The sun is always full <br>
						But the moon is partial <br>
						Now the cloyds group round the mighty sun. <br>
						It rests majestically atop the <br>
						Foundation of the faithful clouds <br>
						It appears to be a shining <br>
						Bright yellow outer red <br>
						Glass orb that appears <br>
						To be the cynosure <br>
						In the midst of the sky that <br>
						Maneuvers round it. <br>
						Back to the man's world I have to go, <br>
						Though, I always long to come back. <br>
						The journey I have set on now <br>
						Will be four years long on the way <br>
						Back <br>

					<h3>Starkiller</h3>
					<p>
						A beacon in the midst of <br>
						Des-pair and des-olation. <br>
						Auspiscious, premature and wile in force. <br>
						A prodigious bastard with no domicile, <br>
						Precocious in force; Mistaken for a <br>
						Jedi, lightyears away by the invader <br>
						Whilst executing the remaining Saints <br>
						Of the Force. <br>
						<br>
						The young boy outstretched his meagre <br>
						But unpredictable arm - <br>
						Like the world in a baby's arms. <br>
						The invader's sabre obediently leviatated <br>
						Into the boy's enigmatic hand. <br>
						A quick "passover" occurred <br>
						And a mechanical mimicry of astonishment <br>
						Washed over the invader's face <br>
						THUS, THE BIRTH (BEGINNING, ORIGN) OF STARKILLER <br>

					<h3>The Right Side of the Street</h3>
					<p>
						The water underneath the <br>
						O'Connell bridge was wavering - <br>
						Like a green fluctuating tinfoil. <br>
						The neon lights - so ambient <br>
						And vibrant; adding colour <br>
						To the dark night sky <br>
						And sombre atmosphere. <br>
						Embracing all simultaneously <br>
						Allowed me to appreciate <br>
						Dublin's authentic resplendence. <br>
						My bus was nigh - <br>
						And slip out of trance, did I <br>
						Until the subsequent encounter; <br>
						I would cherish the stored <br>
						Memory <br>
						In the hereafter. <br>

					<h3>The Other 0.111958%</h3>
					<p>
						When the human being is decomposed <br>
						Into its fundamental parts. <br>
						One may be surprised to find <br>
						That it is survival which remains. <br>
						Family, friends, legacy; <br>
						Survival even in death. <br>
						Disgusting, degenerate creatures <br>
						Spontaneous bastards!!! <br>
